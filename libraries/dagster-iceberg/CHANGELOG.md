# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Spark I/O manager.
- Support for append mode in Iceberg I/O manager. Write mode options can be set via asset definition metadata using the `write_mode` key, or at runtime via output metadata with the same key. Runtime output metadata setting overrides asset definition metadata setting.

### Changed

- Rename I/O managers from `<Storage><Engine>IOManager` to `<Engine><Storage>IOManager`.
- Support for pyiceberg 0.10.0 (#241). Change behavior for how partition field names are calculated to address validation introduced in [pyiceberg #2505](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-python/pull/2305). Partition field names calculated for Dagster asset partitions now include a configurable prefix before the column name they reference. **Migration note**: When updating partition specs on existing tables, new partition field names will be generated using the configured prefix (default: `part_`). For example, a partition field previously named `timestamp` will become `part_timestamp`. Existing data remains accessible, but queries referencing partition fields will need to be updated to use the new naming convention. To maintain backward compatibility, existing tables with unchanged partition specs will retain their original field names until their partition specs are updated.
